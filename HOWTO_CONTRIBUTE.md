# How to Contribute Code to the Repo

## Get started
- create Issue (on github.com)
- create branch by clicking the "create branch" link (on github.com)
- if needed, assign to a "Project"
- if needed, associate with a "Milestone"
- now, start coding and commit in the branch for the issue

## Create unit test(s)
- write a script in directory `utests` that tests the new feature(s)

## When code development is finished
- start pull request: on github.com, select the branch from the dropdown
  (usually saying `master`), then pop open the `contribute` menu on the right,
  and select to start a pull request
- assign reviewer(s) to the pull request
- iterate with the people until everybody is happy
- finally, you or the reviewer merge the pull request into master
